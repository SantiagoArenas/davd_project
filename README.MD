## Neural Networks for Fish Image Recognition
Welcome to this repository, in which an image recognition algorithm is created to attempt to recognize fish species from a picture. The ultimate goal of this project is to push it to production eventually, and be part of the FishOn Ecosystem.

## Data sources
The data found is extensive

## Current methodology


## To do
Identify how the species are categorized.
